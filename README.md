# Acad Notes
This repo contains notes I compiled using [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki).
What you would see here are a combination of copy-pasted words from slides, and thoughts I've had while studying.
With all that being said, some might not be correct ðŸ˜….

## TODO
* When pushing wikis, automate pushing of corresponding newly-converted HTMLs as well.
