==Security==
- noun se·cu·ri·ty \si-ˈkyu̇r-ə-tē\
- the quality or state of being secure:
  - freedom from 
    - *danger*
    - *fear or anxiety*
    - *being laid off*: job security

== What is computer security? ==

Keeping systems, programs, and data "safe"
The CIA Triad:

Confidentiality:: Keep data & resources hidden
  :: Traditional focus of computer security
  :: Privacy is a reason for confidentiality (Freedom from intrusion)
Integrity:: The trustworthiness of the data or resources
  :: Data integrity
  :: Origin integrity - Authentication
  :: System integrity - System still works as expected
Availability:: Being able to use the data or resources
  :: Turning off a computer provides *confidentiality* & *integrity*
  :: but _hurts_ availability

== Security is... ==
Not only adding encryption or technical stuffs,

It's a *systems* issue

Software and Systems are complex:
  - Different OS's contain a lot of lines of code.
  - Systems have a lot of layers (microcode, firmware, OS, libraries, apps, devices)
  - ... and elements (clients, servers, networks, embedded devices)
  - There's also this so-called human factor (more like error)

Now on to the next...

== Security Goals ==
1) Prevention::
  prevent attackers from violating security policy 
2) Detection::
  detect & report attacks 
3) Recovery::
  stop the attack, repair damage 
 
== Policies & Mechanisms ==
Policy:: (1) What is or is not allowed
:: (2) Can be expressed in natural language or mathematics
- policy language (for precision and ease of understanding)

Mechanisms:: Implement and enforce policies

== Policies & Mechanisms ==
Security Architecture:: (1) Concept on how to secure a system
:: - How to strengthen security? Possible weakness?

Security Engineering:: Implement mechanisms & policy into a system

In engineering, we have to make *compromises*

Security 
*VERSUS*
Cost, Performance, acceptability, usability

== Protection ==
Ultimately, who do we want to guard our system from?
* Yourself (clumsily deleting system files)
* Colleagues (privacy)
* Company, Government, Others, etc.

== Risk analysis ==
Should we protect something?

How seriously so? And how much should we spend?

== Definitions ==
Vulnerability:: A failure or bug, basically
Attack vector:: The type of attack to break into a system
Exploit:: [Software|Commands|Instructions] to take advantage of a vulnerability

=== ? ===
What exactly is the difference between Attack vector and exploit?
* Attack vector, as it name suggests, is a means or pathway for the exploit.
  It's the pathway in which the hacker takes to do the bad thing itself,
  aka exploit.
===   ===

Attack (cyber attack):: The use of exploit to subvert security policies and mechanisms in place.
Threat:: entity that can attack
Attack surface:: All the attack vectors in the system.

== Threats ==
Attackers often resort to three Bs:
- Burglary, Bribery, or Blackmail
=== Threat categories ===
- Disclosure: Unauthorized access to date
- Deception: Acceptance of false data
- Disruption: Interruption of correct operation
- Usurpation: Unauthorized control of some part of system
=== Threat actions ===
- Snooping (unauthorized interception of information): c w Cia
- Modification or alteration (""" change """ """): c w cIa
- Masquerading or spoofing (impersonation): c w cIa
- Repudiation of origin (wrongly denying that an entity sent/created smth): c w cIa
- Denial of receipt (""" received data or message): c w cIA
- Delay (temporary) & Denial of service (long-time inhibition of service): c w ciA

Note: counter with *

 = 3rd slide =
Once upon a time, the Internet wasn't as secure as functionality was focused on more

As a result, bad actors can hide at the edges of the network!

The internet, as a result, create vulnerabilities

== Asymmetric force ==
* Actors can project or harness greater force. Low barriers to entry. Offense can be more effective than defense. A small number of actors can have a large effect.
* Imbalance between defender and attacker, as I understand.

== Botnets ==
- Computers(nets) connected to a network but infected(bot) with malicious software
- 3 common uses:
  - DDoS attacks
    - Overwhelm server with too much traffic to "deny others of service"
    - Spam Mailing
    - Cryptocurrency mining

== Attacks ==
- Social engineering
  - manipulate others to action for attackers' benefit.
- Phishing (sending unassuming malicious links in email to random people)
- Spear Phishing (Focused attack)
- Social Media or public (sometimes leaked) databases
  - Use info for future attacks

== Areas of Attack ==
